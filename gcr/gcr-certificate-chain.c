/**
 * GcrCertificateChain:
 *
 * Represents a chain of certificates, normally used to
 * validate the trust in a certificate. An X.509 certificate chain has one
 * endpoint certificate (the one for which trust is being verified) and then
 * in turn the certificate that issued each previous certificate in the chain.
 *
 * This functionality is for building of certificate chains not for validating
 * them. Use your favorite crypto library to validate trust in a certificate
 * chain once its built.
 *
 * The order of certificates in the chain should be first the endpoint
 * certificates and then the signing certificates.
 *
 * Create a new certificate chain with [ctor@CertificateChain.new] and then
 * add the certificates with [method@CertificateChain.add].
 *
 * You can then use [method@CertificateChain.build] to build the remainder of
 * the chain. This will lookup missing certificates in PKCS#11 modules and
 * also check that each certificate in the chain is the signer of the previous
 * one. If a trust anchor, pinned certificate, or self-signed certificate is
 * found, then the chain is considered built. Any extra certificates are
 * removed from the chain.
 *
 * Once the certificate chain has been built, you can access its status
 * through [method@CertificateChain.get_status]. The status signifies whether
 * the chain is anchored on a trust root, self-signed, incomplete etc. See
 * [enum@CertificateChainStatus] for information on the various statuses.
 *
 * It's important to understand that the building of a certificate chain is
 * merely the first step towards verifying trust in a certificate.

 * modules and also that each certificate in the chain is the signer of the
 * previous one. If a trust anchor, pinned certificate, or self-signed certificate
 * is found, then the chain is considered built. Any extra certificates are
 * removed from the chain.
 *
 * It's important to understand that building of a certificate chain does not
 * constitute verifying that chain. This is merely the first step towards
 * trust verification.
 *
 * The @purpose is a string like %GCR_PURPOSE_CLIENT_AUTH and is the purpose
 * for which the certificate chain will be used. Trust anchors are looked up
 * for this purpose. This argument is required.
 *
 * The @peer is usually the host name of the peer whith which this certificate
 * chain is being used. It is used to look up pinned certificates that have
 * been stored for this peer. If %NULL then no pinned certificates will
 * be considered.
 *
 * If the %GCR_CERTIFICATE_CHAIN_NO_LOOKUPS flag is specified then no
 * lookups for anchors or pinned certificates are done, and the resulting chain
 * will be neither anchored or pinned. Additionally no missing certificate
 * authorities are looked up in PKCS#11
 *
 * When the operation is finished, @callback will be called. You can then call
 * gcr_certificate_chain_build_finish() to get the result of the operation.
